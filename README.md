# [My Home server](#my-home-server)

Here's my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I have installed Home Assistant on an old HP laptop for now. The laptop is running as a "Home server". I am currently running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on the laptop. Home Assistant as well as all supporting applications (and some additional non Home Assistant related applications) are running in Docker containers. 

## Things that I run on my Home server (all in Docker containers)

* [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)
* [Zigbee2MQTT](https://koenkk.github.io/zigbee2mqtt/), great development for getting rid of most of the propietary bridges. I use it for all my ZigBee devices except for Hue.
* [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), my favorite MQTT Broker. Used for exchanging data between a lot of applications and from the outside world (through the reverse proxy).
* [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/), for test mainly, not really made for containerizing so stopped moving there with Domoticz.
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org), flow based programming, an intuitive addition to both Home Assistant and Domoticz (or any other home automation system).
* [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), a time series database. Installed, tested with Domoticz but not used yet.
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), analytics and monitoring. Installed, tested with Domoticz but not used yet.
* [Traefik](https://traefik.io/), reverse proxy for secure access from the outside world.
* [Unifi Controller](https://www.ui.com/), for managing my Ubiquiti Access points.
* [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), makes managing my Docker containers easy.  

I plan to move everything to a dedicated NUC in time. Docker should make this simple.

When I find the time I will write a blog or something alike about my Home server.

# [Home Assistant](#home-assistant)


Home Assistant and Domoticz are running in parallel at the moment. I spent quite some time to get the two working together. Home Assistant is the main home automation application.

**I regularly update my configuration files as my Home server is still heavily under development.**

## Home Assistant setup

### Home Assistant configuration
After looking at a ton of configurations and playing around with them I decided to go for packages. All my configurations are now in packages grouped as logical collections of components, entities automations etc.

For example package_notification contains the applied notification components (prowl and pushsafer currently), the associated entities for example the input_boolean that controls if notifications are enabled) and scripts. Scripts are used by many other packages that require  notifications.   

### Lovelace UI
I decided to fully go for Lovelace as the UI. As this is stable since the 0.87 release I moved everything over to Lovelace. [Isabella Gross Alström](https://github.com/isabellaalstrom) has a wonderfull UI that is one of the sources of inspiration for me.
I use a growing number of custom cards and helpers in my Lovelace. I will do some write up on these later but here are the ones I use now.
* [compact-custom-header](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header), card by Ryan Meek (maykar) for customizing the header of your UI. 
* [decluttering-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/decluttering-card), card by Jérôme W (RomRider). This card signifcantly reduces the number of lines in your lovelace configuration. Helps structure your code.
* [mini-graph-card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card), nice graphs of your data can be created with this card. Good work delivered by Karl Kihlström (kalkih).
* [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card), customize your buttons with this card. Started by Alexandre Garcia this card now has many active contributors.
* [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod), Adds CSS styles to (almost) any lovelace card. Powerful custom card by Thomas Lovén (thomasloven) 

When things are progressing I will upload some screenshots of my UI.

# [Devices and services](#devices-and-services)

* Zwave:
  * [Aeotec Z-Stick Gen5](https://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick) Z-Wave controller.
  * [Heatit Thermostat](https://www.heatit.com/heating-control/floor-heating-thermostats/heatit-z-wave-thermostat/) Z-Wave thermostat for controlling the electrical heating in one room.
  * [Neo Coolcam sensors](https://www.szneo.com/) Motion sensors and door/window sensors. Available at Ali Express for competitive prices.
  * [Fibaro smoke sensors](https://www.fibaro.com/en/) The best looking smoke detectors on the market (IMHO).

* Zigbee:
  * [Xiaomi Aqara bridge](https://www.aliexpress.com) The bridge is connected to Domoticz. As Home Assistant is running inside a container, the bridge won't connect (I don't want Home Assistant to run as host on Docker). Sensor values are exchanged through MQTT for now. When I have a better zigbee2mqtt controller (with better radio sensitivity), I will move all over to Home Assistant and retire the bridge (and the privacy unfrienly Chinese app).
  * [Xiaomi Aqara sensors](https://www.aliexpress.com) I use motion sensors, door/window sensors, temp/hum/pressure sensors, a magic cube (nice gadget!) and some buttons. All sensors are connected to Home Assistant (through Zigbee2mqtt)
  * [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com) Philips Hue bulbs used in the house. Operated through the Hue Bridge as I use the scenes in the Bridge for setting the ambiance.
  * [Tradfri](https://www.ikea.com) Cheap ZigBee compatible smart home devices. Currently I only use Wireless control outlets for the more critical switches (replacement of Click-On-Click-Off units). I'm not convinced with the quality and the performance.
  * The Aqara bridge is retired. 

* MySensors platform:
  * [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) The MySensors platform offers a strong solution for developing highly customized sensors and actors. I run a Raspberry Pi as gateway and use NRF24 radio modules. I have developed a [custom water meter sensor](https://www.openhardware.io/view/15/Itron-Aquadis-watermeter-sensor-V10) to read my dumb water meter values. Currently still connected to Domoticz since all my history is logged there as well.

* MQTT:
  * [OwnTracks](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.owntracks/) Presence detection is an important part of the home automation. OwnTracks is used for Geolocation over MQTT.
  * Interfacing to Home Assistant and used for controlling devices that rely on presence.

* Wi-Fi and network:
  * [Netgear Nighthawk](https://www.netgear.nl/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R7000.aspx), the center of all the networking activities in the house. Connects to all devices that require wired networking and to the Wi-Fi AP's. Several unmanaged switches are used to connect wired devices in the house. The Nighthawk submits the status information of all connected devices to Home Assistant. This way I can track if everything is still online. Connected mobile phones are tracked for additional presence detection. 
  * [Unifi AP AC Lite](https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/), the access points I use in the house to support full Wi-Fi coverage for the mobile and Wi-Fi connected devices.

* Voice control:
  * [Amazon Echo Dot 2nd gen.](https://amazon.com), Echo dot 2nd generation used for voice control. Currently this runs through HA-Bridge, an emulated Hue application running on a RPi. Will be exchanged with Home Assistant native Amazon Alexa support in the future.
  * [Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini), currently not in use. But successfully tested with Home Assistant.

* Media devices:
  * [LG Television](https://www.lg.com), my LG television running LG WebOS is controlled by Home Assistant mainly for choosing the correct mode for things like Netflix and Spotify.
  * [Popcorn Hour](https://www.cloudmedia.com/), a classic in my house, the Popcorn A300. Mainly controlled with the Harmony Hub, but some initial settings are done by Home Assistant at startup.
  * [Denon AV3808](https://www.denon.com), also a classic, but with network connect powerful for internet radio and streaming music, direct control over Home Assistant is on the wish list.
  * [Apple TV](https://www.apple.com), not much used anymore these days as the LG can do most of it.
  * [Harmony Hub](https://www.logitech.com), the Harmony Hub, despite Logitech's poor way of supporting interoperability, a powerful device for controlling the media devices. Integrated with Home Assistant. I spent a lot of time in getting it running in Home Assistant. Still some lose ends but I'm getting there.

# [Things planned](#things-planned)

Some projects I have planned:
* MySensors:
  * Water meter sensor version 2.0
  * Light sensor to support better sunscreen control
  * Water temperature sensors for monitoring and tuning the heating system
* Add camera's for home security
* Add motion sensors and automations to switch on lights for orientation at night time

Many ideas. Too little time! I will add some more projects later.

# [Development](#development)

I develop most of my applications in [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VS code has some nice extensions for checking the YAML syntax.

If you have questions on my configuration, ping me on twitter [@rbisschops](https://twitter.com/rbisschops)

If my works helps you reduce time to develop, you can always consider buying me a cup of coffee.
